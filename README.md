# Pokemon Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Pokemon dataset. The dataset includes information about various attributes of Pokemon, such as their types, stats, and legendary status. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and modeling using the KNN (k-nearest-neighbors) model.

## Description

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a Pokemon dataset. It loads the data, conducts data cleaning tasks such as filling missing values, and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) including checking for duplicates and null values. Additionally, it features feature engineering techniques like label encoding and utilizes the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model for predicting Pokemon legendary status, acheiving 97% accuracy with 9 nearest neighbors.
